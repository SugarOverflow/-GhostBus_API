Ghost Bus
==========

This data-backend is part of a semester long project to create an Augmented Reality experience for Brooklyn's B54 bus route. The project involves augmenting the bus' real-time location for riders to be able to visualize how close/far the bus is from their stop. 

This app will interact with the MTA SIRI API and grab B54 data. 
It will then communicate with the Unity3D project in order to reflect the real-time GTFS data.

I am currently attempting to create an Angular JS web app to grab, parse and display the B54 data before integrating the app as a web call in the Unity scene.
